package theclankers.tripview.ui.components



// Used as input to the DraggableList
// Nothing happens when you click the component itself
// Make sure to implement the minus icon that removes the stop from the list
// Grabbing the whole thing anywhere except the minus button allows you to drag and drop it within the list
