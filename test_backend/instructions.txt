Hey Ethan made this for testing front-end routes, there's no database connected
to this backend, I just made it to serve hard-coded data from an endpoint.
I'm just hosting it locally or using ngrok to make a temporary
development endpoint. You can ignore it!

to use:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
